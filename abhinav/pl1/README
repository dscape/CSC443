Analysis
========

The data rate is low when we start at very small block sizes (10 bytes) since
flushing data to disk is very inefficient asd does not align with the block
size of the medium being written to. It increases as we go up to block sizes
of 64K at which we get maximum throughput and then slowly starts to go down 
as we try to flush more data than can be written at once on the medium.

Optimal Read Block: 256K
Optimal Write Block: 64K
