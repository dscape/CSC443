Page Layout
===========

We used `mkcsv.py` to generate a CSV file with 5,000 entries. We then
used `write_fixed_len_pages` and `read_fixed_len_pages` to store and
retrieve the data into heap files. After running the experiment three
times on the data, we got the following results:

![First run][] ![Second run][] ![Third run][]

  [First run]: page-layout/plot-1.png "First run"
  [Second run]: page-layout/plot-2.png "Second run"
  [Third run]: page-layout/plot-3.png "Third run"

Comparison to PL1
-----------------

All three runs exhibited similar behavior: the best write rate was
around page size $2^{14}$ bytes (16 kB) and the best read rate was
around page size $2^{25}$ (32 MB). Note that The experiments performed
on block sizes in the last PL assignment exhibited similar performance
characteristics.

In all cases, whether it was write or read, performance took a massive
drop by the time it got to $2^{30}$ bytes (1 GB). This is expected
because the system is reading from or writing to a 1 GB block of memory
for reads and writes pertaining to a record that consumes only 1,000
bytes, so resources spent accessing all the extra memory are wasted.

Variable Length Encoding
------------------------

Even if variable length encoding was used for records, the overall
performance behaviour of the system as page size is increased will be
the same. The only difference would be that records will consume
slightly more memory and so the page will contain slightly fewer
records.

Versus CSV
----------

Page-based format is obviously superior to CSV. CSV is an expensive
serialization format in both, storage and performance. 

For one, there is no way to traverse a CSV file but linearly. Since
records are not guaranteed to be fixed length, there's no way of seeking
to an absolute position within the CSV file, and so the whole file has
to be traversed to get to the record that was required. Even if the CSV
was sorted, there would still be no way to seek directly to specific
records in the file.

Shortcomings
------------

The way we currently organize pages is on a first-empty-slot basis.
There is no organization of the data inside the pages and so a page has
to be traversed completely to find a record whose offset within the page
is not known.

Secondly, the pages themselves are thrown into a heap file with no
ordering among them. This means that to search the file for a specific
record, all records of all pages will have to be checked linearly.

Heap File
